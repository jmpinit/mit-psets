My MIT Problem Sets
===================

This is a place to document my efforts on my homework (p sets) at MIT. An alternative to the unsatisfying process of sacrificing sleep and sanity for the solutions and then having my efforts lost to the mysts of time in exchange for a few percentage points.

Often the problems are interesting in themselves, and sometimes I manage an interesting solution. So I hope that potential MIT students, or others interested in the subjects I'm taking classes in, will get something useful out of what I document here.
